# Project #1 Concept Proposed on 9/28/2017, which would include a utility to list S3 buckets. The potential scenerio is Big Corp. purchasing Little Corp., using Apache as the Front-End API, a large number of instances of TomCat for Document Storage, and an Oracle Transactional Database, connected by a messaging queue to divisions, which also connects to Amazon Web Services.
# 
# Project #2 Concept Proposed by Professor Chadwick on 9/28/2017 involves possibly getting an AWS Status Dashboard for a neuroscience company that catalogs 3d images of rat brains for various purposes. Communication would include an API that is connected with Fiber-Optics through Light Tower, to manage 25TB of uploads at a time, with constant Amazon Web Services (AWS) Health Status of S3 buckets with data integrity, potentially with CRC checks.
# 
# Project #3 Concept Proposed by Will Rivera on 10/5/2017 involves possibly cataloging Protein DNA from identified diseases. Communication would be of text files with Publish-Subscribe, System Logs, a Dashboard, and Amazon Web Services Monitoring, among other avenues.
